`Little Annie project`

-	In the winter of 1938, the ‘Radio Research Project’ was an attempt to understand how Americans listened to the radio so that they could be more effectively targeted by broadcasters and advertisers. **Theodore W. Adorno** assumed the role of Chief of the Music Division.
-	The project’s crowning achievement was ‘Little Annie’.
-	Little Annie was a simple electronic device that allowed research subjects listening to a radio show to indicate approval or disapproval with the click of a button.
-	A rudimentary version of ‘like’ or ‘thumb’ buttons on contemporary music streaming services, Little Annie revolutionised how early radio, film and television audiences were measured.
-	but, Little Annie did not impress Adorno though. He was positively horrified by the ‘culture industry’ that grew out of such cybernetic forms of measurement.**Simply put, culture, for Adorno, is immeasurable:**

> ‘I reflected that culture was simply the condition that precluded a mentality that tried to measure it’ (cited in Müller-Doohm, 2005, p. 247).

-	**What truly distinguishes these services from previous forms of music consumption is the data feedback loop they generate in real time**.
-	This represents a sea change in how the music industry operates. With listeners drowning in choice, ‘what used to be a question of persuasion’, writes Eric Harvey (2014), ‘has become a problem of prediction’.
-	To date, the subscription model remains a relatively niche market, as most listeners stream music for ‘free’ on ad-supported versions of these platforms.
-	To increase advertising revenue, streaming services attempt to target ads more precisely at listeners.
-	Like the personalization of music, the targeting of ads relies on the harvesting and analysis of vast troves of data

---

`Datafication of Listening`

how such data is collected and used to personalise the listening and advertising experience at two leading streaming platforms: Spotify and Pandora Internet Radio.

:one: Spotify

-	`The Echo Nest`

	-	Spotify itself had cemented the centrality of data analytics for the streaming sector the year before when it paid a reported $58 million for a little-known startup called ‘The Echo Nest’.
	-	The Echo Nest’s acoustic analysis software processes and classifies music according to multiple aural factors from its pitch to its tempo to its danceability.
	-	It then makes connections between that song and other songs with similar progressions or structures.
	-	At the same time, The Echo Nest platform compiles key words found in descriptions of the music and its creators, and then links them to other artists and songs that have been described with similar key words and phrases.
	-	This data is used to determine song similarities on a more cultural level.
	-	Once the world of music has been mapped, The Echo Nest collects a realtime, dynamic record of the type of music fan you are—your music tastes (artists and songs) and music behaviour (favourites, ratings, skips and bans).
	-	This is called your ‘Taste Profile’. Taste Profiles are organised into music segments.
	-	What has been described so far clearly has practical use for song or artist recommendations.

-	`Problems: targeting ads`

	-	With the vast majority of listeners opting for the ‘free’, ad-supported version, this has increasingly become a centra question facing Spotify and other similar streaming services.
	-	Co-founder Brian Whitman even argues that
	-	**‘music preference can predict more about you than anything else’**
	-	The Echo Nest attempts to provide a big data solution by utilising predictive modelling to analyse streaming music listening behaviour in order to identify the psychographic characteristics of listeners: personality, values, opinions, attitudes, interests and lifestyles.
	-	The predictive models that are developed from these incredibly large data sets are continually being trained and validated against ‘ground truth’ survey data.
	-	With the help of The Echo Nest’s analytics, Spotify can create dynamic music segments organised by musical genres and behaviour, ad-targeting segments that include demographics and lifestyles, and custom segments based on music listening activity.
	-	One of the problems facing the music streaming sector is that the bulk of ad-supported accounts on services like Spotify, Pandora and Deezer are inactive.
	-	This means that only a small minority of listeners contributes advertising value to such streaming services. These are the ‘committed, engaged’ listeners referred to by The Echo Nest as “high-value” listeners’ listeners who must be distinguished from the “low-value” tourists who disappear from sight’ (The Echo Nest2013).
	-	By developing a method to identify and represent which categoryeach individual listenerfitsinto, The Echo Nest claims that it can then help music streaming services ‘execute strategies focused specifically on acquiring, engaging, and maximizing the ARPU [average revenue per user] of the likely high value users’
	-	They can be proactively focused on, instead of those listeners who will contribute little advertising value to a service.
	-	This is an example of what communications scholar Joseph Turow (2008, p. 1) describes as **‘marketing discrimination’**, whereby
	-	**‘marketers increasingly use computer technologies to generate ever more carefully defined customer categories or niche that tag consumers as desirable or undesirable for their business’.**
	-	Once a streaming service identifies and separates ‘high-value’ listeners from ‘low-value’ listeners, the next step is once again to create and identify interest and affinity segments for the high-value listeners.
	-	The benefit to music streaming services is obvious: brands and advertisers will pay higher ad rates if they can reach or more accurately,thinkthey can reach high-value listeners.
	-	In short, music streaming space is not only horizontally segmented via consumer categories, it is also vertically ordered via hierarchies of listener value and projections of future worth.

:two: Pandora Internet Radio

-	`The Music Genome Project`

	-	Pandora’s ability to dissect music and to draw correlations between it is dependent on its unique contribution to music taxonomy. Pandora organizes music by musical traits, or ‘genes’.
	-	According to the patent application for the Music Genome Project, the number of genes differs widely between musical genres.
	-	The construction of a music genome is incredibly labour intensive and Pandora does not use machine listening or other forms of automated data extraction.
	-	Once all the attributes for a particular song have been entered, the song is placed topographically within a set of other similar songs using a distance function.
	-	Once the algorithmically chosen song begins to play, the listener is able to give the song a thumbs up if he or she likes it, or a thumbs down if he or she does not.
	-	Every single interaction affects the next song that is delivered to the listener.

-	`Data-Driven Advertising`

	-	Pandora has discovered **‘that the world of playing the perfect music to people and the world of playing perfect advertising to them are strikingly similar’ (Singer2014).**
	-	Pandora has also been digging into its first-party data in order to segment listeners into categories that online advertisers are accustomed to.
	-	Pandora has been steadily rolling out new ad-targeting segments and planning to segment listeners with high household incomes, identified via a combination of census data, registered user information and music taste.
	-	**Pandora has learnt that listeners who exhibit more eclectic music tastes tend also to have higher incomes than the average listener.**
	-	According to the anthropologist Nick Seaver, **Pandora applies a diversity metric to rank the range of a particular listener’s music taste**.
	-	**‘A higher diversity score’, remarks Seaver, ‘should indicate a higher social status, which means that these listeners can have more expensive ads sold against them’** (as cited in Harvey2014).
	-	Relatively simple correlations between age and music listening behaviour can also provide highly informative insights, according to Pandora.

`Political Ad Targeting`

-	It is clear that music streaming services have made much of the assumption that our taste in music reveals who we really are.
-	It should therefore not be a surprise to learn that **the relationship between music taste and political values is a hot topic for music data analysis**.
-	In early 2014, Pandora launched a new ad service aimed at helping political advertisers target Democrat or Republican voters.
-	The service first looks at election result data for a listener’s zip code, determining whether a listener’s county leans Republican or Democrat.
-	It has more recently begun supplementing this data with **information about users’ music tastes and other attributes to create a more valuable profile for advertisers.**
-	It is perhaps no surprise that country music fans lean Republican whereas jazz, reggae and electronic music fans tend to vote for Democrats.
-	Pandora claims that it can more precisely locate listeners on the political spectrum by looking at how diverse their music tastes are and the type of music they prefer within that range.

`Conclusion`

-	The datafication of listening is a remarkably recent development with transformative implications for marketers, the music industry and music fans.
-	As Paul Lamere of The Echo Nest discloses, ‘every time a listener adjusts the volume ... every time they skip a song, every time they search for an artist, or whenever they abandon a listening session, they are telling us a little bit about their music taste’(Lamere2014).
-	Nick Prior (2013, p. 189) writes that **‘music itself and our encounters with it are far more complex than can be conveyed through the idea of social origins, let alone statistical data sets and genre categorizations’**.
-	Nevertheless, particularly for an ad revenue–dependent streaming service such as **Pandora, the point is not so much whether ‘reality’ is being accurately reflected, but whether advertisers (and investors) are sufficiently convincedof the service’s data wizardry.**
-	Furthermore, data is never simply constituted by ‘reality’, it is always at the same time constitutive of ‘reality’. Following Eli Pariser’s (2011) persuasive argument in The Filter Bubble, **the organisation of taste through increasingly detailed measurement and personalisation appears to be leading us towards an increasingly segmented society.**
-	Algorithms have structural implications because they stack onto and amplify already existing differences.
-	Thus, **the categorisation of listeners’ ‘musical identity’ not only reflects social divisions but reinforces and even produces new divisions.**
-	Finally, as with every case of data mining, there is also the issue of **‘function creep’ the slow but steady widening of a system or technology beyond its originally intended purpose.**
-	Listener data may sit in Spotify or Pandora’s database, or it may one daymigrate out, as previously undetermined uses for correlating music taste with some other aspect of our lives are discovered.
-	Discovering unanticipated patterns is precisely what data mining is designed to do.
-	**As a result, the datafication of listening has potential implications that extend far beyond music or adpersonalisation.**
-	**Little Annie, it appears, grew up to bequeath a large extended family of methods; methods that measure what Adorno always insisted was immeasurable.**

-	Human reasoning is innately spatial.
-	W]e are embodied, situated beings, who comprehend even disembodied commu-nications through the filter of embodied, situated experience [Cohen 2007, 213].
-	This appears to be why we constantly invoke place- and space-based metaphorsto describe our online experiences Lefebvre argued that capitalism is notjust about the production of things in space but, perhaps even more importantly,capitalism is about the production of space.
-	Lefebvre insisted on examining the political economy of spaceand what he called the “explosion of spaces” precipitated by capitalism.
-	We can describe the emergence of the Internet as a contemporary, “virtual,”manifestation of the “explosion of spaces”
-	Lefebvre’s theoretical approach positsspace not as a fixed entity that “pre-exists” human interaction, but as a dynamic set ofrelations, actively produced through sociality, in a constantly mutating process
-	this paper will demonstrate how Lefebvre can help generate a morecritical understanding of contemporary music streaming services

'The Production of Music Streaming Spaces'

<details>

<summary> click to expand </summary>

-	Music streaming services can be characterized in Lefebvrian terms as “abstractspaces.” Abstract space is the space of capitalism
-	Music streaming services would not exist today had it not been for the massivedisruption precipitated by Napster and its peer-to-peer (P2P) successors at the turnof the century.
-	The purpose of Napster, according to its founder Shawn Fanning, wasas much about creating a community as it was about making music more accessible.
-	we can understand Napster andsubsequent file sharing services, in Lefebvrian terms, as “social spaces” producedaround the practice of sharing music.
-	The recording industry has largely conceded that if musiccan no longer be exchanged as a commodity, then the focus should shift towardscommodifying the very spaces of music consumption.
-	bstract space is instrumentalspace “manipulated by all kinds of authorities” [Lefebvre 1991, 51]. This sets abstractspace against “social space”

#### (2018.12.12.) Why People Love Spotify’s Annual Wrap-Ups

:newspaper_roll: *The Atlantic*

:writing_hand: *Haley Weiss*

:link: [View this article ](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/12/spotify-wrapped-and-data-collection/577930/)

`Spotify’s Annual Wrap-Ups`

-	I and more than 83 million other Spotify users were treated to this year’s release of the music-streaming service’s annual Wrapped tool, which provides users with an animated slideshow breakdown of their individual listening history for the year.
-	People love Spotify Wrapped. We love the stories that the thousands of hours of music we listened to this year tell about us.
-	to assemble your end-of-year hits playlist, the platform requires detailed information about everything you do and everything you hear when you use a platform many of us spend more time inside than any other.
-	In 2016, the average Spotify user listened to roughly 2.5 hours of audio a day. That’s a colossal amount of data.
-	Its personalized machine-curated playlists are a much-loved feature. And as personal as it is, music is less private than a chat history or cache of photos.

`Some critical views about Spotify`

-	Robert Prey says,

> “The average music listener often uses music as a sort of aural wallpaper. It’s in the background and it’s not that important. It’s fun, and so people don’t take it as seriously.”

-	In a November 2017 paper, the Swedish media scholar Patrick Vonderau coined the term Spotify effect to describe the way the platform has downplayed its market impact while emphasizing its clever design and fun, user-facing features.
-	Spotify’s achievement, the paper concluded, was “the company’s ability to fold markets into each other: to make disappear an aggressive financial growth strategy and business set-up based on ad-tech engineering by creating an aura of Nordic cool and public benefit around its use of music.”

`Data issues`

-	Prey says,

> “We find that there’s incredible detail in the data. There’s all this information: everything from what brand of headphones you’re listening to the music on, to if the volume was changed within songs, whether or not you resize the app’s windows.”

-	In May, a Bank of England project found that it was possible to capture subtleties in peoples’ moods and preferences based on their Spotify listening patterns and other data.
-	For this reason, Prey is concerned that Spotify may become a prime example of what he calls **“function creep.”**
-	**Spotify’s data collection may remain stored away in the cloud**, Prey wrote in a 2016 study,

> “it may one day migrate out, as previously undetermined uses for correlating music taste with some other aspect of our lives are discovered.”
>
> “For example, data collected for the purpose of recommending music may be found to deliver a reliable predictor of financial solvency, IQ, or relationship status. What if a taste for early ’90s Nu Metal indicates a higher propensity to default on a debt repayment?”

-	In other words, Spotify itself may have no real reason for tracking when you adjust the size of your app’s window, and you might not care that it does so.
-	but should an opportunity to monetize that information arise, the company already has it.
-	Prey quips,

> “As people say, data is the new oil.” (Spotify declined to comment on the record for this story.)

:thinking:

`Spotify's Annual Wrap-Ups`

-	Spotify의 Annual Wrap-Ups 기능은 데이터 기반으로 개인화된 플레이리스트를 제공하기 때문에 사용자에게 만족감을 줄 수 있다.
-	그러나, Prey가 지적한 것처럼, 스트리밍을 서비스를 통해 말그대로 우리는 음악을 그저 귀로 흘려보내고 있는 것은 아닐까?
-	나의 2018년 플레이리스트 100개의 음악을 살펴보니 곡 제목이 굉장히 생소하게 다가온다. 음악을 듣고 나서야 자주 들었던 곡이구나 고개가 끄덕여진다.
-	한 가지 흥미로운 부분은 어떤 뮤지션의 곡은 다수 리스트에 올라와 있었다는 것인데, 그것의 의미가 해당 뮤지션의 음악이 어느 정도는 내 취향이라는 말해주기 때문이다(다만, 스트리밍을 사용하는 방식에 따라 오류가 있을 수는 있다).
-	나의 경우에는 나얼의 곡이 6곡이나 포함되어 있었는데, 내가 가장 좋아하는 뮤지션이었기 때문에, 신기하게 다가왔다. 나도 모르게 자주 들었던 것인가...
-	그래서 하고 싶은 말은 평소에는 스트리밍을 통해 음악을 흘려보내고 있기 때문에, 정기적으로(1년은 너무 길다) 사용자가 어떤 뮤지션의 음악을 자주 듣고 있는지 알려주는 방법도 괜찮을 것 같다.
-	현재는 음악들이 넘쳐 빠르게 흘러가고 있기 때문에, 그 중 아무것도 잡지 못하고 기억에서 사라져만 간다. 가끔은 내가 듣는 음악마다 왜 이렇게 다 비슷비슷한가 싶기도 하다(이것은 또 다른 문제라 나중에 언급해야겠다).
-	음악이 흘러가다가 잠시 정착할 필요도 있지 않을까? 그러는 과정에서 새로운 뮤지션을 발견할 수 있지 않을까? 내 취향에 맞는 새로운 뮤지션을 만났을 때의 기쁨을 Spotify에서도 느낄 수 있을까?

`데이터 이슈`

-	데이터에 관련한 이슈는 모든 IT 기업들이 피해갈 수 없는 문제이다. Prey의 연구에 따르면 Spotify도 데이터를 클라우드에 저장하고 있을 것이라고 하는데, 이런 데이터들이 오직 사용자의 음악 추천을 위해서만 쓰일 것인가?
-	기업들이 데이터의 사용을 투명하게 공개하지 않는 이상 그 부분을 알 수 있는 방법이 없다. function creep를 어떻게 감시할 수 있을까? 문제 제기를 통해 법적인 효력이 닿을 수 있도록 해야하는 것일까?
-	이 질문에 대한 부분은 추후에 다양한 사례를 통해 살펴봐야할 것 같다.
