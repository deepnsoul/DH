`Spotify’s Annual Wrap-Ups`

-	I and more than 83 million other Spotify users were treated to this year’s release of the music-streaming service’s annual Wrapped tool, which provides users with an animated slideshow breakdown of their individual listening history for the year.
-	People love Spotify Wrapped. We love the stories that the thousands of hours of music we listened to this year tell about us.
-	to assemble your end-of-year hits playlist, the platform requires detailed information about everything you do and everything you hear when you use a platform many of us spend more time inside than any other.
-	In 2016, the average Spotify user listened to roughly 2.5 hours of audio a day. That’s a colossal amount of data.
-	Its personalized machine-curated playlists are a much-loved feature. And as personal as it is, music is less private than a chat history or cache of photos.

'Some critical views about Spotify'

-	**“The average music listener often uses music as a sort of aural wallpaper,”** says Robert Prey, **“It’s in the background and it’s not that important. It’s fun, and so people don’t take it as seriously.”**
-	In a November 2017 paper, the Swedish media scholar Patrick Vonderau coined the term Spotify effect to describe the way the platform has downplayed its market impact while emphasizing its clever design and fun, user-facing features.
-	Spotify’s achievement, the paper concluded, was “the company’s ability to fold markets into each other: to make disappear an aggressive financial growth strategy and business set-up based on ad-tech engineering by creating an aura of Nordic cool and public benefit around its use of music.”

`Data issues`

-	“We find that there’s incredible detail in the data,” Prey says.

```
"There’s all this information: everything from what brand of headphones you’re listening to the music on, to if the volume was changed within songs, whether or not you resize the app’s windows.”
```

-	In May, a Bank of England project found that it was possible to capture subtleties in peoples’ moods and preferences based on their Spotify listening patterns and other data.
-	For this reason, Prey is concerned that Spotify may become a prime example of what he calls **“function creep.”**
-	Spotify’s data collection may remain stored away in the cloud, Prey wrote in a 2016 study,

```
“it may one day migrate out, as previously undetermined uses for correlating music taste with some other aspect of our lives are discovered.”
```

-	"For example, data collected for the purpose of recommending music may be found to deliver a reliable predictor of financial solvency, IQ, or relationship status. What if a taste for early ’90s Nu Metal indicates a higher propensity to default on a debt repayment?"

-	In other words, Spotify itself may have no real reason for tracking when you adjust the size of your app’s window, and you might not care that it does so. - but should an opportunity to monetize that information arise, the company already has it.

-	“As people say,” Prey quips, “data is the new oil.” (Spotify declined to comment on the record for this story.)
